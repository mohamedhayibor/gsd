GSD (Get Shit Done or Get Stuff Done)
----

This module will notify you of the number one task to get done every 5 minutes. (instead of browsing twitter, Hacker News, or doing anything else).

## Installation
  `npm install -g gsd`

Don't forget the "-g", install it globally. (then you can run gsd everywhere)

## Usage

On your terminal:

```
  > gsd finish setting up tooling
```
notification message: "finish setting up tooling" will pop up every 5 minutes.

## Raison d'être
The reason why I created this, is because motivational quotes don't cut it for the most of us. Yes, when you read them you feel good but it is a dirty high (like sugar high). At the crash you feel miserable and realize you haven’t accomplished shit.

Solution extreme GSD:
> Just pick one task and beat it to submission.
